# Coin Price Toy

A simple Flutter app to list the coins availabile on coingecko.com and show a
chart with a price calculator for a specific coin if the user chooses one.

***Tests.*** This repo is meant as an example, and as such contains no tests.
The formatting is heavily influenced by VS Code's linter for Dart/Flutter.  This
should not be considered production code.

***Devices.*** At the time of this writing, this has only been tested on the
Android device emulator.  While it likely works as expected on other actual
devices, certain ones (iOS) may require some configuration for network access.

***Boilerplate.*** The relevant logic should all be within `./lib/src`; the rest
of what's in this repo is Flutter generated scaffolding.
